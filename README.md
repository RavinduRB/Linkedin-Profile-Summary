       $accessToken = getAccessToken(); // Assuming a function for OAuth

       $profileData = fetchLinkedInData($profileUrl, $accessToken);
       echo json_encode($profileData);
   }

   function fetchLinkedInData($profileUrl, $accessToken) {
       $url = "https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me";
       $headers = array("Authorization: Bearer $accessToken");

       $ch = curl_init();
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
       $response = curl_exec($ch);
       curl_close($ch);

       if ($response) {
           return json_decode($response, true);

   function displayProfileData(data) {
       // Populate About Section
       document.getElementById('about').innerText = data.about || 'No data available';

       // Populate Connections & Followers Chart
       const ctx = document.getElementById('followersChart').getContext('2d');
       new Chart(ctx, {
           type: 'line',
           data: {
               labels: data.followers.dates,
               datasets: [{
                   label: 'Followers',
                   data: data.followers.counts,
                   borderColor: '#0073b1',
               }]

For each profile section (e.g., Experience, Education), additional JavaScript and PHP functions will be necessary to dynamically load and display data. 

Let me know if you need help with specific code segments for each profile feature!

---

If the "Fetch Profile" button is not working, here are some common troubleshooting steps to get it working with HTML, JavaScript, and PHP. I'll go through the setup to make sure everything is correctly connected.

### 1. Check the Button and JavaScript Event Listener
Make sure your button in the HTML has an ID, and that JavaScript is correctly targeting it. Here’s an example:

#### HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>LinkedIn Profile Summary Viewer</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>LinkedIn Profile Summary Viewer</h1>
        
        <!-- Input field for LinkedIn profile URL or username -->
        <input type="text" id="profileUrl" placeholder="Enter LinkedIn profile URL or username">
        <!-- Fetch Profile button -->
        <button id="fetchProfileButton">Fetch Profile</button>
        
        <!-- Placeholder for profile data -->
        <div id="profileData"></div>
    </div>
    
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. JavaScript: Add Event Listener for the Button
In your `app.js` file, make sure you have an event listener attached to the "Fetch Profile" button.

#### JavaScript (app.js)
```javascript
// Wait until the DOM is fully loaded
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    // Get the Fetch Profile button
    const fetchProfileButton = document.getElementById("fetchProfileButton");
    
    // Add click event listener to the button
    fetchProfileButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
        // Get the profile URL from the input field
        const profileUrl = document.getElementById("profileUrl").value;
        
        // Basic validation to check if input is not empty
        if (profileUrl.trim() === "") {
            alert("Please enter a LinkedIn profile URL or username.");
            return;
        }

        // Fetch the profile data
        fetchProfileData(profileUrl);
    });
});

// Function to fetch profile data
function fetchProfileData(profileUrl) {
    // Fetch data from the PHP backend
    fetch("php/linkedin_api.php", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ profileUrl: profileUrl })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Display the data in the profileData div
        const profileDataDiv = document.getElementById("profileData");
        profileDataDiv.innerHTML = `<pre>${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>`;
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error fetching profile data:", error);
    });
}
```

### 3. Backend: PHP Script to Fetch LinkedIn Data (linkedin_api.php)

This PHP file will simulate data fetching. In a real application, you would use LinkedIn's API, but here’s a simple PHP example that echoes back a mock response.

#### PHP (php/linkedin_api.php)
```php
<?php
header("Content-Type: application/json");

// Read the input data from JavaScript
$input = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"), true);

// Check if profileUrl was provided
if (!isset($input['profileUrl'])) {
    echo json_encode(["error" => "No profile URL provided."]);
    exit;
}

// Mock profile data (replace this with LinkedIn API code if you have access)
$profileUrl = $input['profileUrl'];
$response = [
    "name" => "John Doe",
    "headline" => "Software Developer at Example Company",
    "connections" => 500,
    "followers" => 1500,
    "summary" => "Experienced developer in web technologies.",
    "profileUrl" => $profileUrl
];

// Return the mock profile data as JSON
echo json_encode($response);
?>
```

### 4. Check Console for Errors
Open the browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing `F12`), then navigate to the **Console** tab. Look for any JavaScript errors, such as:

- **Network Errors**: If `linkedin_api.php` is not found, you may have an incorrect path or server configuration.
- **CORS Errors**: If you're using a local server (e.g., `localhost`), CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) might block the request. This usually won’t happen if everything is on the same server, but keep an eye out.
  
### 5. Ensure PHP is Running
Make sure you’re running a local server that can execute PHP, like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP. Simply opening `index.html` directly in a browser without running a server will not allow the JavaScript to make a request to a PHP script.

1. Place your project in the `htdocs` folder (XAMPP) or the equivalent directory for your local server.
2. Start the server and access your project by navigating to `http://localhost/your-project-folder/index.html` in the browser.

### 6. Test and Debug
1. **Enter a profile URL or username** into the input field.
2. **Click "Fetch Profile"** and check if the profile data (mocked response) appears in the `profileData` div.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the mock profile data returned by `linkedin_api.php` displayed on the page.
